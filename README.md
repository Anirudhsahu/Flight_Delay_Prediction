## Overview
The purpose of this project is to predict flight delays to enhance passenger convenience and improve airline operational efficiency. By analyzing historical data, we develop models that can predict potential delays, thereby aiding airlines and passengers in making informed decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical flight records, including:

Departure and arrival times

Airline information

Weather conditions

Airport specifics

Note: Ensure to update the dataset path in the notebook if you store it in a specific folder or if you use a different dataset.

## Installation & Requirements
To use this project, perform the following:

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

Navigate to Flight_Delay_Prediction.ipynb and open it.

Run the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train models, and evaluate the results.

## Models Used
This project includes the following machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

K Neighbors

Decision Tree

Random Tree

Gaussian Naive

Light GBM

XG Boost

Ada Boost

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. A comparison of these metrics across different models provides insight into which model performs best under given circumstances.
